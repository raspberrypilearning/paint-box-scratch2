## What next?
Now that you have completed the 'Paint box' project, try [the 'Boat race' project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/boat-race){:target="_blank"}, which helps you make a game where you have to stir a boat around obstacles.

Or if you want to do more projects that involve art, choose one of [our other art-related projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?interests%5B%5D=art){:target="_blank"}.

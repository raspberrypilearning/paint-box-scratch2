## Challenge: keyboard commands
Can you add code so that, instead of clicking on the coloured squares or buttons on the Stage, you can make things happen by pressing keyboard keys? For example:

+ <kbd>b</kbd> = Switch to blue pencil
+ <kbd>g</kbd> = switch to green pencil
+ <kbd>e</kbd> = switch to eraser
+ <kbd>c</kbd> = clear screen

If you want to, you can also add code so that pressing the arrow keys changes the pen width.
